prompt: The following is a table of data for a choose-your-own-adventure book set in high school. Chris Middleman the most popular kid in school is having a crazy party at the weekend which you really want to get invited to. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices. The game is won when you are invited to the party, or lost when Chris tells you that you can't come. In the book the text is very descriptive and written in exciting language. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. The choices can involve interacting with items, navigating or talking to characters. No page should have similar long page text to another page. At least one page ends with the reader winning. If a page has no choices that link to its page number it should be empty and have no choices.
