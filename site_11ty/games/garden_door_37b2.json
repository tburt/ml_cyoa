Overdue bills are scattered across your desk, a testament to your failing freelance graphic design career. Half-finished projects mock you from the screen of your aging laptop, each one a reminder of your creative block and mounting debt. The silence of the room is broken by the shrill ring of your mobile. Your mother. \n\nEleanor's calls are never truly 'casual'. There's always an underlying current of expectation, a subtle pressure to conform to her idea of how your life should be. You haven't been back to Oakhaven, your childhood home in Lower Slaughter, for far too long, and she never lets you forget it. A knot of anxiety tightens in your stomach. What does she want this time? A request? An instruction? Another guilt trip?\n\nThe phone continues to ring, the sound grating on your nerves. Each ring is a reminder of the mounting pressure you are under. A life you can't seem to get a grip on.",
