prompt: The following is a table of data for a choose-your-own-adventure book where you are trying to balance five rocks on top of each other to impress your partner. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices. The game is won when you successfully balance the five rocks, or lost when your partner loses interest. In the book the text is very descriptive and written in exciting language. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. The choices can involve interacting with items, navigating or talking to characters.
