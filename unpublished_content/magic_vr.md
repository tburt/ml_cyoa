prompt: The following is a table of data for a choose-your-own-adventure story where you have just bought an incredible new VR headset which is going to blow your mind. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices. The game is won when you finally get the headset to work, or lost if it breaks. In the story the text is very descriptive and written in evocative language. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. The choices can involve interacting with items, navigating or talking to characters. The first page describes your quest. The story is around 20 pages long.
