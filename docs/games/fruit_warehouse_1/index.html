<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>The following is a table of data for a choose-your-own-adventure book about trying to escape an exciting but dangerous fruit warehouse. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices. The game is won when you escape the warehouse, or lost if you die. In the book the text is very descriptive and full of hyperbole. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. The choices can involve interacting with items, navigating or talking to characters. No page should have similar long page text to another page. At least one page ends with the reader winning. If a page has no choices that link to its page number it should be empty and have no choices.</p>
