<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>This is a fun and unpredictable choose your own adventure story, where you are John Middleman, a recruitment officer who in their spare time has created a Time Machine which he&#39;s very excited to try out for the first time. His overall motivation is to be reunited, even temporarily with his dead Grandfather, to find out why his Grandmother disappeared when he was a child. But on the way to this goal he may get into various crazy adventures, before finally managing to go back 20 years and find his grandfather in the family home. Make sure you create an exciting and mysterious reason for the Grandmother&#39;s disappearance while you&#39;re creating the background. The story should be an strange mixture of comical and dark. Don&#39;t be afraid to introduce dark and even shocking concepts. </p>

Wires snake across the floor, competing for space with recruitment brochures from your day job. A half-disassembled toaster oven sits next to a stack of circuit boards scavenged from old computers. And, of course, there's the time machine. \n\nIt's not exactly the sleek, chrome contraption you see in movies. More like a washing machine someone tried to turn into a rocket. It’s a mess of exposed wires, blinking lights, and a repurposed dentist’s chair. But after years of tinkering, you're pretty sure it's ready. The air crackles with ozone, and the machine hums with a nervous energy that mirrors your own.\n\nYour main reason for building the thing was to see your Grandfather again, who died when you were still in college. He was the only one who ever really understood you. But another reason – a darker, more persistent one – is to finally figure out what happened to your Grandmother. She vanished without a trace when you were a kid. One day she was there, baking cookies and humming old songs, the next, she was gone. The official story was that she’d run off with another man. But you never bought it. You remember finding a strange, intricately carved charm of hers, etched with swirling symbols and a disturbing, almost reptilian eye. And then there were those pages from her diary - talk of a secret society and whispers of a dark family legacy.\n\nNow, staring at your jury-rigged time machine, a wave of doubt washes over you. Is this really a good idea? What if you mess something up? Or worse, what if you find out the truth about your Grandmother, and it's something you can't handle?","choices":[{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e002","content":"Double-check the flux capacitor calibration.

Rip off the bandage and face whatever happens."}],"end":null},"john_lab_john_lab_e002":{"content":"You lean in, peering at the flux capacitor's gauges. The needle on the primary gauge is twitching erratically, and the digital display flickers between several different dates, none of them making any sense. That's probably not right. A quick scan of your schematics reveals a minor miscalculation in your wiring. Nothing major, just a crossed connection that could send you to, well, pretty much anywhere. You carefully re-route the wires, double-checking the polarity to avoid any…unpleasant surprises.\n\n      As you tighten the final screw, you can't help but wonder if you're making the right choice. Maybe you should just leave the past alone. But the image of your Grandmother, her face etched with a worry you didn't understand as a child, flashes in your mind.

It's surprisingly comfortable, considering where you found it. You flip the master switch, and the time machine groans to life. Lights flicker, wires spark, and the air fills with the smell of ozone and burning solder. You set the destination date – twenty years ago, to the day your Grandfather last seemed like himself - and grip the activation lever.\n\n      The machine's vibrations intensify, rattling your teeth and blurring your vision. You notice that your coffee cup has vibrated off the desk, smashing on the floor. You wonder whether that was actually a bad omen, and whether you should call the whole thing off. But at least you're committed now. No going back.","choices":[{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e007","content":"Begin the temporal displacement sequence.

The time machine bucks and whines, throwing you back against the dentist's chair. Sparks erupt from the control panel, and the air crackles with raw energy. The numbers on the destination display spin wildly, settling briefly on your intended target date before dissolving into gibberish. You can barely see anything now, but you hold on tight, bracing for the jump. You squeeze your eyes shut, hoping that whatever's about to happen doesn't involve being turned inside out, or worse, failing to reach the destination.\n\n      The roar of the machine intensifies, reaching a deafening crescendo.

Hold tight."}],"end":null},"temporal_drift_e100":{"content":"The lab dissolves completely, replaced by an endless, swirling chaos of colors and shapes. You're adrift in the temporal currents, a tiny speck of consciousness tossed about in a sea of infinite possibilities. Snatching glimpses of fragmented images, you see flashes of your childhood home, distorted versions of your lab, and strange, alien landscapes that defy description. The controls on the time machine are going haywire, dials spinning, lights flashing in a maddening, unpredictable pattern. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and something else… something ancient and indescribably strange.\n\n      You realize with a growing sense of dread that you've lost control. The time machine is no longer guiding you; it's being dragged along by the chaotic currents of time itself. You're completely at its mercy now.","choices":[{"entry_id":"temporal_drift_e101","content":"Grip the control stick tightly.

Sparks shower from the console, and the lights flicker even more erratically. You can feel the temporal currents buffet you, threatening to rip the stick from your grasp. The swirling chaos outside intensifies, and you catch a glimpse of something truly unsettling: a fleeting image of a shadowy figure standing just outside the time machine, its eyes glowing with an unnatural light. You're not alone in this temporal storm.\n\n      You pull back on the control stick with all your might, hoping to regain some control. But the machine resists, fighting you every inch of the way. You can feel something beginning to crack under the strain. Has the stick been damaged? Has the whole machine been damaged?","choices":[{"entry_id":"temporal_drift_e104","content":"Try to force the control stick even harder. Maybe you can muscle the machine into submission.

Maybe a more subtle approach is needed."}],"end":null},"john_lab_john_lab_e003":{"content":"You pick up your Grandmother's diary, the leather cover cracked and worn from years of disuse. The pages smell faintly of lavender and something else… something mustier, older. You start flipping through it, your eyes scanning the familiar handwriting that trails off into increasingly frantic scrawls. There are dates and times, places you vaguely remember from childhood, and then there are the symbols. Strange, twisting shapes that look like nothing you've ever seen, except for that charm you found years ago. \n\nYou pause at a passage where she mentions a group called the 'Ascendants'. The entry is short, just a few lines: 'They came again tonight. Whispers in the dark. They want what's in our blood. I fear for John.' The word 'Ascendants' is underlined three times, and next to it, she's drawn a symbol that looks like a serpent eating its own tail.","choices":[{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e006","content":"Reread the text again, and search more specifically for clues related to the Ascendants."},{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e001","content":"Put the diary away, closing the book.

They're scattered throughout, but a pattern starts to emerge. The entries become more frequent closer to the time of her disappearance. She writes of 'ceremonies' and 'obligations,' words that drip with dread. You see repeated mentions of the family home, always accompanied by a sense of foreboding. \n\nA recurring symbol, a stylized eye within a triangle, is etched near almost every mention of secret passages and late-night rituals. It's crudely drawn, like she was trying to hide it, but it's there, nonetheless. One entry reads: 'The house remembers. It watches. The Ascendants will come, drawn by the bloodline. Protect John.'","choices":[{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e008","content":"Zero in on the diary entries that focus on the family home and its significance."},{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e001","content":"Close the diary, feeling overwhelmed by the implications. This is getting way too intense."}],"end":null},"john_lab_john_lab_e008":{"content":"You scan the entries related to the family home, noticing that several of them include what looks like a set of hand-written co-ordinates. They're scribbled in the margins, almost hidden amongst the frantic writing, but they're definitely there. You pull out an old, tattered map of the area around your family home, a relic from your childhood. The map is faded and torn, but still legible. The co-ordinates seem to correspond to a specific location within the estate, possibly near the old woodshed or the overgrown gardens. \n\nYou carefully copy the co-ordinates onto a separate piece of paper, double-checking each digit. You can't shake the feeling that this location is the key to everything, a place of great importance to both your Grandmother and the Ascendants.","choices":[{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e009","content":"Carefully note the location on the tattered map for future reference, marking it with a red pen."},{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e001","content":"Ignore the implications of the co-ordinates, deciding to focus on the immediate task at hand: activating the time machine."}],"end":null},"john_lab_john_lab_e009":{"content":"You now have the co-ordinates of what could be a vital location within your family estate scribbled down on the tattered map. It's circled in red ink, a stark contrast to the faded paper and faded memories. You glance at the time machine, its lights blinking impatiently.

You consider the implications. Armed with a specific location, you might actually be able to find her.","choices":[{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e004","content":"Use these co-ordinates as a destination in the time machine, setting the dials and firing it up!

The lab plunges into near darkness for a moment, the only light coming from the arcing electricity within the time machine itself. Sparks shower from the overloaded circuits, filling the air with the sharp smell of ozone. The machine groans, a tortured sound of metal straining against impossible forces. You grab hold of the repurposed dentist chair, bracing yourself for the unknown, as the temporal displacement field roars to life.","choices":[{"entry_id":"john_lab_john_lab_e007","content":"Hold on tight and hope for the best! There's no turning back now."}],"end":null},"temporal_drift_e102":{"content":"You reach for the primary dial, the one you usually use to set the destination year. The numbers are just a blur of light now. You hope you remember the right settings, but honestly, you were usually just guessing anyway. There's a faint smell of burning from somewhere inside the machine, which can't be good. Your stomach lurches as the temporal currents buffet you around. You realise that if you don't get this sorted soon, there will be no Grandfather to see, no Grandmother mystery to solve. Just you, scattered across the timeline like confetti. You figure you can either try and be really careful and precise, or just give it a good whack and see what happens. Either way, you can't stay here forever.","choices":[{"entry_id":"temporal_drift_e106","content":"Fine-tune the primary dial, slowly and precisely."},{"entry_id":"temporal_drift_e107","content":"Give the primary dial a hard, desperate spin."}],"end":null},"temporal_drift_e106":{"content":"You nudge the dial incrementally, trying to remember which way makes the numbers go up and which way makes them go down.

But then the machine lurches violently, throwing you against the side of the dentist's chair. Sparks fly from the dial, and the smell of burning gets stronger. That didn't work.

You take a deep breath and steel yourself for another attempt at controlling this chaotic mess. The images that flash through your mind are becoming more vivid: the family home, your Grandmother’s charm, those strange cult rituals in abandoned barns.

You grab the dial and spin it with wild abandon, like you're trying to win a prize on a rigged game show. The machine howls in protest, the vortex morphing into an even more chaotic swirl of colours. You catch glimpses of bizarre landscapes, monstrous creatures, and terrifying versions of yourself. This is getting dangerous, definitely. You feel a strange pull, like you're being drawn towards something, or someone. You wonder if it is possible for a machine to develop a mind of its own. You wonder if it's possible that your Time Machine might be angry, because you haven't followed the instructions properly.","choices":[{"entry_id":"temporal_drift_e113","content":"Apologise to the time machine."}],"end":null},"temporal_drift_e103":{"content":"Your voice cracks as you yell into the swirling chaos. It's swallowed instantly, like a raindrop in the ocean. The temporal vortex doesn't seem to care about your family dramas. The machine rattles around you, lights flashing erratically.

You are going around and around, shoutin in vain. The flashing lights are starting to hurt your eyes. The scent of ozone is overpowering. This is probably a really bad idea.

The whole idea seems ludicrous, now, but that was the point, wasn't it?","choices":[{"entry_id":"temporal_drift_e108","content":"Try shouting again, but louder. This is ridiculous, but you are desperate, and that's all you have left."}],"end":null},"temporal_drift_e104":{"content":"With a sickening crack, the control stick snaps clean off in your hand. Sparks shower from the console, briefly illuminating your face. The vortex outside intensifies, the swirling colors becoming more violent, more chaotic.

It seems forcing the issue wasn't the best approach. Now you're left with a broken control stick and a time machine that's even more out of control than before. Time to try something else – anything else – before you end up scattered across the spacetime continuum.","choices":[{"entry_id":"temporal_drift_e110","content":"Apologise to the time machine.

The smell of ozone is overpowering. Reality itself seems to fray at the edges, the swirling vortex resolving into brief, disjointed images: a medieval battlefield, a futuristic city, your own lab, but twisted and distorted. It feels like the dodgy calibration has had even dodgier results, and something's gone seriously wrong.\n\nMaybe if you hadn't forced the control stick so hard, you wouldn't be in this mess. But dwelling on it won't fix anything. You need to find a way out of this temporal storm, and fast.

Fragments of your past – a birthday party with a lopsided cake, a schoolyard fight where you lost badly, a fleeting glimpse of your grandmother's gentle smile – collide with surreal and impossible images: Roman legions marching through your office, dinosaurs roaming your street, a giant rubber ducky floating in space. You fight to maintain focus, desperately trying to regain control of the machine, or at least your own sanity.\n\nThe jumbled images are disorienting, like trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle with pieces from a dozen different sets. You can feel the boundaries of time and space blurring, the past, present, and future all merging into a single, chaotic moment. You need to find an anchor, something to ground you in this swirling vortex of temporal anomalies.","choices":[{"entry_id":"wild_time_bubble_w002","content":"Focus on the image of your grandfather.

The surrounding chaos begins to recede slightly, replaced by a sense of calm, almost peace.\n\nThe image of your Grandfather seems clearer than ever, you see the slight crinkles around his eyes, and the concerned expression he always wore when you were in trouble.

What message is he trying to convey?\n\nYou feel a sense of anticipation building, a feeling that you're on the verge of a breakthrough, a revelation that could change everything.

The year is 20 years ago, a time when your grandfather was still alive, and before your grandmother vanished. The air crackles with an unspoken tension, a feeling that something is not quite right.

Are you now destined to follow in her footsteps, fighting a battle you can't possibly win? The music box seems to hum with a silent energy, a ghostly echo of her presence.

You briefly consider trying to disrupt the ceremony further, but the longer you stay, the greater the risk of getting caught, or worse. You decide to trust your gut and make a run for it, music box in hand. If you can get clear, you can find a safer place to examine it, away from the incense and the weird chanting.

Maybe the ritual is running behind schedule, or maybe he's worried about being caught. Whatever the reason, he seems like a weak link in the chain, a potential escape route.

Messing with the past, even with the best intentions, could have unforeseen consequences. A tiny change could ripple through time, creating a future you can't even imagine. \n\nMaybe some things are better left undisturbed. Maybe the timeline is like a delicate ecosystem, and any interference could throw it completely out of balance.

You find mentions of gatherings in abandoned places, whispers of rituals performed under the moonlight. Nothing concrete, but enough to pique your interest. You dig deeper, searching old news archives and obscure forum posts. You find a few references to a group calling themselves 'The Illuminated Path,' who seem to be obsessed with ancient bloodlines and forgotten knowledge.
