It advertises a Lionel Richie tribute night from what looks like the late 90s, the flyer adorned with jagged edges and the phone number beginning with '01902' - a real blast from the past.\n\nTurning back to the bar, you decide to ask the barman a question.","choices":[{"content":"Ask the barman about his favourite Lionel Richie album cover.","entry_id":"e7ea9"},{"content":"Enquire if he's going to the album release party tonight, trying to gauge how busy it might get.","entry_id":"ecb42"}],"end":null},"e4fc7":{"entry_id":"e4fc7","content":"Barry enthusiastically describes the music lineup and the specially themed drinks that will be available at the release night event. He promises a night of pure Lionel Richie bliss, with tunes spanning his entire career and a few deep cuts you've probably never heard before. The signature cocktail, the 'Dancing on the Ceiling', is a vibrant concoction of rum, pineapple juice, and blue curaçao, promising to transport you straight to the 80s.\n\nYou exit 'Dancing on the Ceiling', clutching the new Lionel Richie album. The quest is complete! A wave of triumph washes over you as you consider the lengths you went to, and the slightly absurd reason for the album's scarcity. You might even consider returning later for the release party. The taste of victory is sweet, and it smells faintly of pineapple and blue curaçao.","choices":[],"end":"win"},"ea42f":{"entry_id":"ea42f","content":"You notice a faded \"Open\" sign hanging crookedly, one hinge protesting with a rusty squeal. The lettering is peeling away, revealing glimpses of the wood underneath. It's as if time itself forgot to update this place. Stepping inside, a bell above the door announces your arrival with a tired jingle.\n\nThe air inside is thick with the smell of dust, old paper, and well-worn vinyl. Behind the counter, a man with a long, grey-streaked beard is hunched over a stack of records. He wears a cardigan with mismatched buttons and seems utterly absorbed, humming along to a tune only he can hear. He looks up at you with a momentary flicker of recognition, then returns to his task, seemingly uninterested in new releases or the outside world.\n","choices":[{"content":"Head towards Wolverhampton's outdoor market, searching through a box overflowing with old cassette tapes, hoping for a forgotten gem.","entry_id":"e0a1f"},{"content":"Head towards Wolverhampton's outdoor market.","entry_id":"e7c87"}],"end":null},"e58f3":{"entry_id":"e58f3","content":"In your haste, you trip over a pile of clothes you strategically discarded last night, nearly sprawling onto the floor. A stray sock clings to your ankle like a stubborn barnacle. This day is off to a *fantastic* start, you think, dusting yourself off.\n\nFully awake now, the adrenaline of the situation floods your system. Secure that album! You begin the process of getting ready, a sense of purpose driving your every move.\n\nThe radio's still blaring Lionel Richie's release when you're finally ready.
