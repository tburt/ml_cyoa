<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>The following is a table of data for a choose-your-own-adventure book about a time traveller John Wanknot trying to get home to his own time. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices. The game is won when John gets back to his own time and is reunited with his family, or is lost when John dies or gets stuck in the wrong time period. In the book the text is very descriptive and written in exciting language. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. Each choice is an option of what you say to David. No page should have similar long page text to another page. At least one page ends with the reader winning. If a page has no choices that link to its page number is should be empty and have no choices.</p>
