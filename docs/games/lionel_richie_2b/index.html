<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>The following is a table of data for a choose-your-own-adventure book set in a town where your are desperately trying to buy the new Lionel Richie CD, but every shop seems to be sold out. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices. The game is won when you obtain the new CD, or lost when the shops close for the evening. In the book the text is very descriptive and written in exciting language. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. The choices can involve interacting with items, navigating or talking to characters. No page should have similar long page text to another page. At least one page ends with the reader winning. If a page has no choices that link to its page number is should be empty and have no choices. A reader should have to make around 6 choices to get to a win or lose state.</p>
