<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>The following is a table of data for an exciting choose-your-own-adventure book where you play a grumpy old man called Mr Shillfinger who refuses to sell your house to property developers. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices. The game is won when either the property developers give up, or lost if you lose your house to the developers. In the book the text is very descriptive and full of hyperbole. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. The choices can involve interacting with items, navigating or talking to characters. All the pages should be very different to each other. At least one page ends with the reader winning. If a page has no choices that link to its page number it should be empty and have no choices. The book is around 20 pages long.</p>
