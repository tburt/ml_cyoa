<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>The following is a table of data for an ambitious choose-your-own-adventure book where a sad squirrel is making a last attempt to find a legendary nut before he dies. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices with complex decisions to be made. The game is won when either the legendary nut is found, or lost if you die. In the book the text is very descriptive and full of hyperbole. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. The choices can involve interacting with items, navigating or talking to characters. All the pages should be very different to each other. At least one page ends with the reader winning. If a page has no choices that link to its page number it should be empty and have no choices. The book is around 20 pages long.</p>
