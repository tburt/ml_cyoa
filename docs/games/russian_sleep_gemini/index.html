<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>We are writing a choose your own adventure based on the creepypasta &#39;The Russian Sleep Experiment&#39;. Here is the original story:

```### The Russian Sleep Experiment

Russian researchers in the late 1940s kept five people awake for fifteen days using an experimental gas-based stimulant. They were kept in a sealed environment to carefully monitor their oxygen intake so the gas didn&#39;t kill them, since it was toxic in high concentrations. This was before closed circuit cameras, so they had only microphones and five-inch-thick glass porthole-sized windows into the chamber to monitor them. The chamber was stocked with books and cots to sleep on (but no bedding), as well as running water, a toilet, and enough dried food to last all five for over a month.

The test subjects were political prisoners deemed enemies of the state during World War II.

Everything was fine for the first five days; the subjects hardly complained, having been promised (falsely) that they would be freed if they submitted to the test and did not sleep for 30 days. Their conversations and activities were monitored, and it was noted that they continued to talk about increasingly traumatic incidents in their past. The general tone of their conversations took on a darker aspect after the four day mark.

After five days, they started to complain about the circumstances and events that lead them to where they were and started to demonstrate severe paranoia. They stopped talking to each other and began alternately whispering into the microphones and one way mirrored portholes. Oddly, they all seemed to think they could win the trust of the experimenters by turning over their comrades, the other subjects in captivity with them. At first, the researchers suspected this was an effect of the gas itself...

After nine days, the first of them started screaming. He ran the length of the chamber repeatedly, yelling at the top of his lungs for three hours straight, at which point he continued attempting to scream, but was only able to produce occasional squeaks. The researchers postulated that he had physically torn his vocal cords. The most surprising thing about this behavior was how the other captives reacted to it... or rather, didn&#39;t react to it. They continued whispering into the microphones until the second of the captives started to scream. The two non-screaming captives took the books apart, smeared page after page with their own feces, and pasted them calmly over the glass portholes. The screaming promptly stopped.

So did the whispering into the microphones.

After three more days passed, the researchers checked the microphones hourly to make sure they were working, since they thought it impossible that no sound could be occurring with five people inside. The oxygen consumption in the chamber indicated that all five must still be alive. In fact, it was the amount of oxygen five people would consume at a very heavy level of strenuous exercise.

On the morning of the 14th day, the researchers did something they said they would not do to get a reaction from the captives; they used the intercom inside the chamber, hoping to provoke any response from the people they were afraid were either dead or vegetables.

They announced: &quot;We are opening the chamber to test the microphones; step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom.&quot;

To their surprise, they heard a calm voice respond in a single phrase: &quot;We no longer want to be freed.&quot;

Debate broke out among the researchers and the military forces funding the research. Unable to provoke any more response using the intercom, it was finally decided to open the chamber at midnight on the fifteenth day.

The chamber was flushed of the stimulant gas and filled with fresh air, and immediately, voices from the microphones began to object. 3 different voices began begging, as if pleading for the life of loved ones, to turn the gas back on. The chamber was opened and soldiers were sent in to retrieve the test subjects. They began to scream louder than ever, and so did the soldiers when they saw what was inside.

Four of the five subjects were still alive, although no one could rightly call the state that any of them in &#39;life.&#39; The food rations past day five had not been so much as touched. There were chunks of meat from the dead test subject&#39;s thighs and chest stuffed into the drain in the center of the chamber, blocking it and allowing four inches of water to accumulate on the floor. Precisely how much of the water on the floor was actually blood was never determined. All four &#39;surviving&#39; test subjects also had large portions of muscle and skin torn away from their bodies. The destruction of flesh and exposed bone on their finger tips indicated that the wounds were inflicted by hand, not with teeth as the researchers initially thought. Closer examination of the position and angles of the wounds indicated that most, if not all of them, were self-inflicted.

The abdominal organs below the ribcage of all four test subjects had been removed. While the heart, lungs and diaphragm remained in place, the skin and most of the muscles attached to the ribs had been ripped off, exposing the lungs through the ribcage. All the blood vessels and organs remained intact, but had been taken out and laid on the floor, fanning out around the eviscerated but still living bodies of the subjects. The digestive tract of all four could be seen to be working, digesting food. It quickly became apparent that what they were digesting was their own flesh that they had ripped off and eaten over the course of days.

Most of the soldiers were Russian special operatives at the facility, but still, many refused to return to the chamber to remove the test subjects. The subjects themselves continued to scream to be left in the chamber and begged and demanded that the gas be turned back on, lest they fall asleep...

To everyone&#39;s surprise, the test subjects put up a fierce fight in the process of being removed from the chamber. One of the Russian soldiers died from having his throat ripped out, and another was gravely injured by having his testicles ripped off and an artery in his leg severed by one of the subject&#39;s teeth. Another five of the soldiers lost their lives, if you count the ones that committed suicide in the weeks following the incident.

In the struggle, one of the four living subjects had his spleen ruptured and bled out almost immediately. The medical researchers attempted to sedate him, but this proved impossible. He was injected with more than ten times the human dose of a morphine derivative and still fought like a cornered animal, breaking the ribs and arm of one doctor. His heart was seen to beat for a full two minutes after he had bled out, to the point there was more air in his vascular system than blood. Even after it stopped, he continued to scream and flail for another three minutes, struggling to attack anyone in reach and just repeating the word &quot;MORE&quot; over and over, weaker and weaker, until he finally fell silent.

The surviving three test subjects were heavily restrained and moved to a medical facility, the two with intact vocal cords continuously begging for the gas, demanding to be kept awake...

The most injured of the three was taken to the only surgical operating room that the facility had. In the process of preparing the subject to have his organs placed back within his body, it was found that he was effectively immune to the sedative they had given him to prepare him for the surgery. He fought furiously against his restraints when the anesthetic gas was brought out to put him under. He managed to tear most of the way through a four-inch-wide leather strap on one wrist, even through the weight of a 200 pound soldier holding that wrist. It took only a little more anesthetic than normal to put him under, and the instant his eyelids fluttered and closed, his heart stopped.

In the autopsy of the test subject that died on the operating table, it was found that his blood had triple the normal level of oxygen. The muscles that were still attached to his skeleton were badly torn, and he had broken 9 bones in his struggle to not be subdued. Most of them were from the force his own muscles had exerted on them.

The second survivor had been the first of the group of five to start screaming. His vocal cords destroyed, he was unable to beg or object to surgery, and he only reacted by shaking his head violently in disapproval when the anesthetic gas was brought near him. He shook his head yes when someone suggested, reluctantly, that they should try the surgery without anesthetic, and did not react for the entire six hour procedure of replacing his abdominal organs and attempting to cover them with what remained of his skin. The surgeon presiding stated repeatedly that it should not be medically possible for the patient to still be alive. One terrified nurse assisting the surgery stated that she had seen the patients mouth curl into a smile several times, whenever his eyes met hers.

When the surgery ended, the subject looked at the surgeon and began to wheeze loudly, attempting to talk while struggling. Assuming this must be something of drastic importance, the surgeon had a pen and pad fetched so the patient could write his message. It was simple. &quot;Keep cutting.&quot;

The other two test subjects were given the same surgery, both without anesthetic as well (although they had to be injected with a paralytic for the duration of the operation). The surgeon found it impossible to perform the operation while the patients laughed continuously. Once paralyzed, the subjects could only follow the attending researchers with their eyes. The paralytic cleared their system in an abnormally short period of time, and they were soon trying to escape their bonds. The moment they could speak, they were again asking for the stimulant gas.

The researchers tried asking why they had injured themselves, why they had ripped out their own guts, and why they wanted to be given the gas again. Only one response was given: &quot;I must remain awake.&quot;

All three subject&#39;s restraints were reinforced and they were placed back into the chamber, awaiting determination as to what should be done with them. The researchers, facing the wrath of their military &#39;benefactors&#39; for having failed the stated goals of their project, considered euthanizing the surviving subjects. The commanding officer, an ex-KGB, instead saw potential, and wanted to see what would happen if they were put back on the gas. The researchers strongly objected, but were overruled.

In preparation for being sealed in the chamber again, the subjects were connected to an EEG monitor and had their restraints padded for long term confinement. To everyone&#39;s surprise, all three stopped struggling the moment it was let slip that they were going back on the gas. It was obvious that, at this point, all three were putting up a great struggle to stay awake. One of the subjects that could speak was humming loudly and continuously; the mute subject was straining his legs against the leather bonds with all his might, first left, then right, then left again for something to focus on. The remaining subject was holding his head off his pillow and blinking rapidly. Having been the first to be wired to the EEG machine, most of the researchers were monitoring his brain waves in surprise. They were normal most of the time, but sometimes flatlined inexplicably. It looked as if he were repeatedly suffering brain death, before returning to normal. As they focused on paper scrolling out of the brainwave monitor, only one nurse saw the man&#39;s eyes slip shut at the same moment his head hit the pillow. His brainwaves immediately changed to that of deep sleep, then flatlined for the last time as his heart simultaneously stopped.

The only remaining subject that could speak started screaming to be sealed in now. His brainwaves showed the same flatlines as the one who had just died from falling asleep. The commander gave the order to seal the chamber with both subjects inside, as well as three researchers. One of the named three immediately drew his gun and shot the commander point blank between the eyes, then turned the gun on the mute subject and blew his brains out as well.

He pointed his gun at the remaining subject, still restrained to a bed as the remaining members of the medical and research team fled the room. &quot;I won&#39;t be locked in here with these things! Not with you!&quot; he screamed at the man strapped to the table. &quot;WHAT ARE YOU?&quot; he demanded. &quot;I must know!&quot;
full

The subject smiled.

&quot;Have you forgotten so easily?&quot; the subject asked. &quot;We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night. We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread.&quot;

The researcher paused, then aimed at the subject&#39;s heart and fired. The EEG flatlined as the subject weakly choked out, &quot;So... nearly... free...&quot; ```

Your job is to create a game *inspired* by this story, but you will have to be creative with how you turn it into a game, you can use as much artistic license as you like! But make sure you keep the tone and atmosphere of the original story. The game should focus on someone discovering the old premises, a decade later, and gradually uncovering the truth of what happened there. Perhaps at the end, they discover one subject still alive and transcended to a new realm of madness (not savable) and flee. Keep it realistic, with nothing explicitly paranormal. </p>

That the echoes of their screams still linger in the air, a symphony of madness conducted by the wind. You came seeking answers, driven by a morbid curiosity and the faint hope of uncovering some shred of truth buried beneath layers of lies and propaganda. Now, standing on the precipice of this forgotten nightmare, you can almost taste the fear that permeates the air. \n\nA gaping maw yawns in the building's side, a consequence of structural decay, or perhaps something more… deliberate. The wind howls through the shattered windows, carrying with it the metallic tang of rust and something else, something indefinable yet deeply unsettling. Above the entrance, a faded and peeling sign, barely clinging to the crumbling wall, depicts a hammer and sickle, symbols of a regime that sought to control even the very essence of human nature.

A wrong step could easily turn an ankle, or worse. You notice a thick, viscous fluid staining the concrete near the entrance, its color too dark to be rust. It's almost black in places, slick and congealed. You can't be sure what it is, but your gut tells you to avoid it. The air hangs heavy with anticipation, as if the building itself is holding its breath, waiting to see if you're foolish enough to enter.

You sweep the beam of your flashlight across the interior walls, revealing peeling paint and the skeletal remains of what might have been desks or chairs. A rat scurries across your path, disappearing into the darkness. The silence presses in on you, broken only by the sound of your own breathing and the occasional drip of water.

The walls are slick with moisture, and the stench of decay is almost overwhelming. Faded posters, their images long since obscured by time and grime, cling to the walls, hinting at a past that is both alluring and terrifying. A sliver of light spills from the end of the corridor, beckoning you forward like a siren's call.

The air instantly chills, a palpable wave of cold washing over you. You feel as though you're crossing an invisible boundary, leaving behind the familiar world and entering a realm of shadows and forgotten nightmares. The floorboards groan under your weight, each creak a mournful lament. A faint, metallic scent, reminiscent of dried blood, fills your nostrils, adding to the growing sense of dread. You grip your flashlight tighter, your knuckles white. Your heart pounds in your chest, a frantic drumbeat against the oppressive silence. There's no turning back now.

Peeling paint hangs from the walls like ragged shrouds, revealing faded layers of Soviet-era propaganda – images of smiling workers, heroic soldiers, and slogans promising a bright future, now mocking reminders of a broken dream. Broken light fixtures dangle precariously from the ceiling, their shattered glass scattered across the floor like glittering tears. A thick layer of dust coats every surface, undisturbed for decades, a testament to the building's abandonment. The air is heavy with the cloying smell of mildew and rot, a suffocating reminder of the passage of time. Before you, three distinct paths present themselves. To your left, a main corridor stretches into the darkness, leading towards what appears to be the research wing. To your right, a shadowy passage disappears into the bowels of the facility – the maintenance corridors.

A gash, thankfully not too deep, bleeds freely. The metallic tang of blood mixes with the already oppressive atmosphere. You curse your impatience. Now, you have a painful, and potentially infected, wound to deal with. The darkness of the facility seems to deepen, mocking your carelessness. You clutch your leg. You can either attempt to treat the wound, or try to ignore it and press on, hoping it doesn't slow you down too much, or become infected.","choices":[{"entry_id":"abandoned_facility_a006","content":"Tear a strip from your clothing and try to staunch the bleeding as best you can, despite the unsanitary conditions."},{"entry_id":"abandoned_facility_a005","content":"Ignore the injury, grit your teeth, and push forward.

You wrap the makeshift bandage tightly around the gash on your leg, wincing at the pain. It's a crude fix, but it should at least slow the bleeding and offer some protection against infection. The dampness of the rag, however, is unsettling, but you cannot worry about that now. You notice a faint, coppery stain already seeping through the bandage. You can feel the blood trickling down your leg, a constant reminder of your recklessness. You take a deep breath, steeling yourself. The bandage will have to do. You have to keep moving. You hope the material will hold up. You may have to replace it later. This also means you now know one of the dangers of charging on regardless.","choices":[{"entry_id":"abandoned_facility_a005","content":"Continue onward, your leg bandaged, the pain a constant reminder of your mistake."}],"end":null},"entrance_hall_e101":{"content":"The main corridor stretches before you, a bleak and oppressive tunnel leading deeper into the heart of the facility.

A faint, metallic scent hangs in the air, growing stronger with each step, a ghostly echo of blood spilled in the name of science.","choices":[{"entry_id":"entrance_hall_e102","content":"Continue down the seemingly undisturbed corridor, determined to uncover the secrets that lie hidden within the research wing."}],"end":null},"entrance_hall_e102":{"content":"As you continue down the main corridor, the oppressive atmosphere intensifies.

The subjects' bodies are pushed beyond their limits, their resilience tested to the breaking point. You can almost feel their pain, their exhaustion, their desperate struggle for survival.

The source of the noise seems to be nothing more than a few scavenging rats, their eyes glinting red in the light. They scatter as you approach, their claws scrabbling against the concrete floor. It's a dead end. A wasted opportunity born of paranoia and desperation. The metallic clang you heard must have been the rats dislodging something. There's no way out this way. With a sigh of resignation, you turn back towards the main tunnel, the moonlight beckoning you onwards.","choices":[{"entry_id":"escape_route_er008","content":"Rush toward the exit anyway, hoping you haven't lost too much ground."}],"end":null},"escape_route_er011":{"content":"You can't resist. You glance back. The facility stands silent against the moonlit sky, its dark windows like empty sockets staring into your soul. For a moment, you see nothing. Then, a figure shuffles into existence, silhouetted in the doorway, its eyes burning with an unholy light. It raises a hand, a gesture that is both a farewell and a curse. A guttural scream tears through the night air. The horror claims you as its own, its tendrils wrapping around your mind, dragging you back into the darkness. You remember its chilling words: 'I must remain awake'.","choices":[],"end":"lose"},"escape_route_er009":{"content":"Giving up on forcing the door, you grit your teeth and squeeze through the narrow gap. Jagged edges of rusted metal rake against your skin, tearing your clothes and drawing beads of blood. You ignore the pain, driven by a desperate need to escape. You feel a sharp tug as you finally wriggle free, emerging on the other side, bruised, bleeding, but alive. The moonlight beckons, a pale beacon in the oppressive darkness. You stagger to your feet, the adrenaline pumping through your veins. The Subject's distorted howls echo behind you, a constant reminder of the horrors you're trying to escape. You need to keep moving, to put as much distance as possible between yourself and the nightmare you're leaving behind. The air smells acrid, like burnt metal and decay, but there's a faint hint of something fresher, something cleaner, on the breeze. Is it the promise of freedom, or just a cruel illusion? It doesn't matter. You have to keep going.","choices":[{"entry_id":"escape_route_er008","content":"Ignoring the lingering pain, you stumble towards the beckoning light, your heart pounding with a mixture of fear and hope.
