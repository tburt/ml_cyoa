<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>This is a detective based choose your own adventure story, where you play a UK policeman in the North of England in the grimy 1970s. A crime has taken place and you are the detective in charge of interviewing the 4 suspects involved. You must then pick who you think the criminal was and charge them. The story&#39;s structure will have to be quite simple, where you can freely move between interviewing the suspects, exploring the crime scene, or charging a suspect (which will lead to an ending). The best way to structure this is a central hub scene that leads to three more scenes: &#39;interviews&#39;, &#39;evidence&#39; or &#39;charge a suspect&#39;. The scene &#39;interviews&#39; leads to each of the four interview scenes or back to the hub, and so on. In the background briefing you will have to spell out the exact details of the crime (and the true criminal/s) and all evidence and clues so that the writers can provide the correct amount of clues as they write the individual entries. The story should be gritty and realistic.</p>

Rain lashes against the grime-streaked windows of your cramped office, each drop a tiny drumbeat counting down the seconds you don't have. A half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sits on your desk, ringed with the stains of countless others. It's the kind of night that seeps into your bones, a fitting backdrop to the grim task ahead.\n\nPeter Vickers is dead. Found this morning in his own home, a single stab wound to the chest. A local businessman, though 'businessman' feels like too clean a word. Whispers of dodgy dealings, money skimming, and connections to the wrong sort have been circling Vickers for years. Now, those whispers are screams, and it's your job to sift through the noise and find the killer.\n\nThe interview rooms are cold and sterile, ready to receive your suspects.

Vickers wasn't just bending the rules; he was tearing them up and using them for kindling. You sift through deposit slips, invoices, and what appear to be records of off-the-books transactions. The deeper you dig, the murkier it gets. One thing is clear: Vickers was involved in some seriously shady business. The question is, can you decipher these numbers and link them to a suspect?

Stanley Whitaker, the cold, calculating businessman, his eyes betraying nothing. And Arnold Price, the broken man, consumed by resentment and regret. \n\nEach one a suspect, each with a reason to want Peter Vickers dead. You need to tread carefully, to probe their weaknesses, to expose their lies. This interrogation could make or break the case, so who will it be? What could they be hiding? What can you get from them? And more importantly, who will be the first person through your door?","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_selection_is002","content":"Question Hal McIntyre.

He shuffles into the interview room, avoiding eye contact. His cheap suit looks like it's about to fall apart at the seams, and the smell of stale beer and desperation clings to him. He's a small-time player in a big game, and he looks terrified. Maybe that fear will work in your favor. Time to see what he knows about Peter Vickers, the hidden documents, and the shifty dealings of this case. You signal for DI Willis to bring him in.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_a_ia001","content":"Proceed with the interview.

The air smells of stale tobacco and burnt coffee. The coffee machine sputters, filling a chipped mug with a brew that's more brown than black. Sergeant Miller shuffles over, his face a roadmap of sleepless nights and cheap whisky. He stubs out a cigarette on the overflowing ashtray, the scent mingling with the rest of the fug. Miller's been on the force for twenty years; he knows this city's underbelly like the back of his hand. He's got a nose for the streets, a gut feeling for when something isn't right. Maybe he knows something you don't. You need a new angle on this case.","choices":[{"entry_id":"police_station_ps006","content":"Listen to Miller's hunches.

A plume of smoke rises, momentarily obscuring his face. \"He's got that practiced look, the one they get when they're telling you what they *think* you want to hear. Something about his story doesn't sit right. Too clean, too convenient.\" He takes a swig of coffee, grimacing. \"Just a feeling, mind you. But I'd keep an eye on him.\" You thank Miller for his thoughts, knowing that his 'feeling' is often as good as solid evidence. You drain your lukewarm coffee and consider your next move. That seed of doubt about Stanley Whitaker has been firmly planted.","choices":[{"entry_id":"police_station_ps012","content":"Follow up on Miller's tip about Whitaker. Check his alibi and background for any inconsistencies."}],"end":null},"police_station_ps012":{"content":"The rain continues to fall, blurring the city lights outside your window. Miller's words echo in your mind: 'Something the police missed...' It gnaws at you. What could have been overlooked? Was it deliberate, or simply a consequence of a rushed investigation? Either way, you can't shake the feeling that you're missing a key piece of the puzzle. But whatever the case, the next step should be to interview the suspects, so you can get to the bottom of what happened. \n\nBack in your office, the suspect photos seem to glare at you, their faces swimming in and out of focus as the rain intensifies. Each has a motive, a past, and a secret to protect. You resolve to focus on the interviews. It's time to separate the lies from the truth, the innocent from the guilty. This starts now, as the weight of the case presses down on you.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_selection_is001","content":"Start the interviews. Bring in the first suspect and begin the interrogation."}],"end":null},"interview_selection_is003":{"content":"You signal to the uniformed officer outside your office. \"Bring in Hodgson,\" you instruct. A few moments later, Leslie Hodgson is ushered in, his eyes darting around the room. He exudes an uncomfortable confidence and claims he has an air-tight alibi for the night of Vickers' death. He seems almost too eager to cooperate. Time to test his story and see if he can maintain his composure under pressure. You want to see if he can handle the heat.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_b_b001","content":"Bring him in for questioning. Start the interrogation and see how his alibi holds up."}],"end":null},"interview_suspect_b_b001":{"content":"Leslie Hodgson enters the interrogation room with a confident swagger, a barely perceptible smirk playing on his lips. He takes a seat opposite you, crosses his legs, and smiles. His suit is slightly too tight across the shoulders, and his hair is slicked back meticulously with what smells like cheap pomade. 'Right, detective,' he says smoothly, his voice a touch too loud for the small space, 'what can I do for you?' He appears relaxed, perhaps even a little too relaxed. Like he's playing a part, and you're not sure what the play is.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_b_b002","content":"Ask about his relationship with Peter Vickers. See if you can catch him in a lie about his feelings toward the victim."},{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_b_b003","content":"Ask about his whereabouts on the night of the murder.

Everyone seems to be dancing around the truth, carefully omitting key details. You've got statements from Hal McIntyre, Leslie Hodgson, Arnold Price, and a brief one from a nervous informant down by the docks. Hodgson's alibi seems airtight, but something about the others feels off. McIntyre keeps contradicting himself, Price is a simmering cauldron of barely-controlled rage, and the informant is clearly terrified. Someone's hiding something, that's for sure. The question is, who is most likely to crack under pressure and reveal what they know?","choices":[{"entry_id":"police_station_ps010","content":"Focus on Arnold Price's conflicting statements. His volatile temper might be his undoing."},{"entry_id":"police_station_ps011","content":"Re-evaluate Hal McIntyre's 'accidental' slip-ups. Maybe his loose tongue will reveal more than he intends."}],"end":null},"police_station_ps011":{"content":"Hal McIntyre's statement is a jumbled mess of half-truths and nervous ramblings. He claims to have been 'just minding his own business,' but keeps letting slip details about Vickers' dealings and the general atmosphere in the city's underbelly. It's like he's trying to appear innocent while simultaneously hinting at more than he knows. His information is unreliable, but these inconsistencies might point to something important. You can either dismiss him as a low-level crook trying to sound important, or push him further to see what else he might reveal. After all, even a broken clock is right twice a day. Perhaps McIntyre's rambling holds a crucial piece of the puzzle.","choices":[{"entry_id":"police_station_ps012","content":"Take a walk and think it through. This case is a tangled web and you need some fresh air to clear your head before going any further."}],"end":null},"interview_selection_is004":{"content":"You steel yourself. It's time to face Stanley Whitaker. He's a known player in the city's criminal underworld, and his cool demeanor suggests he's not easily intimidated. His business relationship with Peter Vickers had reportedly soured recently, giving him a potential motive. You press the buzzer, summoning him to the interview room. It is sure to be a challenging encounter. Bring him in.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_c_sw001","content":"Confront Whitaker. See if you can crack his carefully constructed facade."}],"end":null},"interview_suspect_c_sw001":{"content":"Stanley Whitaker enters the room with a slow, deliberate pace. His tailored suit and polished shoes stand in stark contrast to the drab surroundings. He doesn't offer a greeting, simply taking a seat and fixing you with a cold, unwavering stare. He exudes an aura of controlled power, a man accustomed to getting his way. 'Let's get this over with,' he says, his voice smooth but with an undercurrent of steel. The silence hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the hum of the fluorescent lights.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_c_sw002","content":"Ask about his relationship with Peter Vickers.

He leans back in his chair, considering his words. 'Vickers and I... we had a business arrangement. Certain... financial services. Nothing more. He understood the value of discretion.' He pauses, letting his words sink in. His tone suggests that their relationship was purely professional, but you sense that he's downplaying something significant. The 'financial services' he mentions could be anything from legitimate investments to illicit money laundering. You get the sense that he's used to cleaning up his messes, and very good at it. Time to dig deeper and expose the truth.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_c_sw004","content":"Press him for specifics about their business dealings. Push him to reveal the true nature of their 'financial services'."},{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_c_sw005","content":"Change the subject abruptly, mention the bloodied knife found at the scene.

Something spooked them proper.\" He pauses, exhaling a plume of smoke. \"They're all whisperin' about Vickers, but they ain't whisperin' to us. Too scared.\" He leans closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur. \"Heard a few things... they're saying something was found at Vickers' house, something the police missed. Something important, something that points to who really did it.\" He stubs out his cigarette, a worried look on his face. \"Whatever it is, it's got them terrified. More terrified than just a murder, know what I mean?\" Miller shakes his head, grabs the coffee and sips it, and makes a face. 'I think it's about what Vickers was into. It's got to be, hasn't it. This is above street level crime. I'd put money on it.'","choices":[{"entry_id":"police_station_ps012","content":"Head back to Vickers' house. Maybe the local police missed something vital. Time to take a look yourself."}],"end":null},"interview_selection_is005":{"content":"You signal to the constable outside your door. \"Bring in Price,\" you say. A moment later, Arnold Price is ushered into the room, his shoulders slumped, his eyes darting nervously around. He looks like a man on the verge of collapse. His clothes are rumpled, his hair unkempt. There is the air of desperation about him, something close to the look on his face the day that Vickers took the roof from above his family, and his life began to collapse. \n\nThe motive is certainly there. You've got a witness who says he has a temper, but will he provide a story? Is he the killer?","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_d_d001","content":"Start the questioning. No point in delaying the inevitable."}],"end":null},"interview_suspect_d_d001":{"content":"Arnold Price slumps into the chair, the metal legs scraping against the concrete floor. He avoids your gaze, fixing his attention on a point somewhere over your shoulder. His hands fidget in his lap, twisting a crumpled handkerchief into a tight knot. \"I didn't do it,\" he mumbles, his voice barely audible. It's a preemptive strike, a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion before you even begin. He shifts uneasily, the harsh fluorescent light accentuating the lines of worry etched on his face. The smell of cheap tobacco and fear hangs heavy in the air. He looks like a man who's been carrying a burden for far too long. He starts to say something, but thinks better of it.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_d_d002","content":"Establish his alibi: \"Tell me exactly where you were on the night of the murder, Mr. Price.\""},{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_d_d003","content":"Cut to the chase: \"Let's talk about your relationship with Peter Vickers. You tell me everything.\""}],"end":null},"interview_suspect_d_d002":{"content":"\"I was at home,\" Price says, his voice wavering slightly. \"Alone. All night.\" He hesitates, then adds, \"Watching telly.\" It's a weak alibi, easily challenged. No witnesses, no corroboration. Just a man alone in his house on the night of a murder. You make a note in your pad. It seems like he has something to hide, but can you catch him?","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_d_d004","content":"Drill down on the details: \"Walk me through the evening, Mr. Price.

Nobody can vouch for you?\""}],"end":null},"interview_suspect_d_d004":{"content":"Price shifts uncomfortably in his seat, his gaze flickering around the room. \"I... I don't know exactly,\" he stammers. \"I didn't keep track. It was just a normal night. I came home, had some dinner, watched the telly, and went to bed.\" His voice cracks, and he swallows hard. \"I don't need anyone to vouch for me. I was just there. Alone.\" The desperation in his voice is palpable. He's trying to convince you, but he's also trying to convince himself. Is he lying, or is he simply a broken man struggling to remember a mundane evening? Either way, his story is falling apart under the slightest pressure. The cracks in his alibi are widening, but are they wide enough to drive a conviction through?","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_d_d008","content":"Attack the weakness directly: \"Mr. Price, you have no alibi.

The fight has gone out of him, leaving behind only a hollow shell. You thank him for his time, and the constable escorts him out of the room. He shuffles out like a man walking to his own execution. You scribble some notes, summarizing the interview. Arnold had motive and opportunity, but his story just doesn't hold water. His rage is palpable, his resentment burns brightly, but there's a hollowness to his account, a lack of conviction that suggests he's more bark than bite.

'Some...some film. On the BBC. Old one,' he stammers, a bead of sweat trickling down his temple. 'A Western, I think.' The way he says it, without any conviction, screams that he's lying.

'The name of the film, Mr. Price. You were watching it all evening, you must remember something.' He fumbles, unable to recall even the vaguest details. 'Oh, I don't know... High Noon? The Magnificent Seven? One of those, maybe?' He becomes increasingly flustered and angry, his voice rising in pitch. The sweat is now pouring down his face, and he's breathing heavily. He starts ranting about Vickers, how he ruined his life, his family, everything. He eventually breaks down, sobbing uncontrollably into his hands. You're left with the strong feeling that while Arnold certainly hated Vickers, he's not the cold-blooded killer you're looking for.

He shifts in his seat, the fabric of his worn trousers rustling. 'I was upset. I lost everything.' He pauses, his voice dropping to a near whisper. 'But I didn't kill him.' His knuckles are still white, pressed hard against each other. The anger is palpable, a raw, burning resentment that fills the small room. You lean forward, trying to gauge the sincerity in his voice, the truth behind his words. The weight of his ruined life hangs heavy in the air, a tangible presence.

'Maybe I did!' he shouts, his voice echoing in the confined space. The outburst is sudden, violent, and immediately followed by a wave of regret. He shrinks back in his chair, his eyes wide with fear. 'But I didn't kill him! I swear, I didn't!' His contradictions pile up, a tangled mess of anger and denial. You make a note, but his story just doesn't fit. His animosity is clear, but the facts aren't consistent with his testimony. You conclude that Arnold Price is not your man. He's broken, angry, and possibly delusional, but not a killer. The interview is over, but the questions still linger.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_d_d016","content":"End the interview.

The fight seems to have drained out of him. You see a flicker of the man who lost everything, not a cold-blooded killer. The raw anger is still there, but it feels unfocused, undirected, like a storm that's blown itself out. He's a broken man, alright, but not the kind who'd carefully plan a murder. More like the kind who'd shout and rant until his voice gave out. He's certainly capable of violence, or perhaps he once was, but the evidence before you shows that Vickers had been killed by someone cold, and calculated.\n\nYou push the papers in front of you away, the clatter of them on the desk surface echoing in the room. The interview's over, at least as far as suspecting Price goes. He's got his motives and some evidence stacked against him, but there's no way he committed the act, he just doesn't have it in him. You know that this is a game, and that even though he may be guilty of some other crime, he didn't do this one. You lean back in your chair and sigh.

Just before... just before...' His voice trails off, choked with emotion.\n\n            His story reveals a clear motive and his well-documented temper makes him a viable suspect. But as you listen to him, something doesn't quite add up. The rage is there, the resentment is palpable, but the cold calculation of a murderer seems absent. He's a broken man, fueled by anger and regret, but not necessarily a killer. The interview is coming to a close. You conclude that Arnold Price is not your man.\n            ","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_d_d016","content":"End the interview.

Just me, the telly, and a packet of fags.' The sweat on his brow glistens under the harsh light. You can practically smell the lie clinging to him like cheap aftershave. He's hiding something, that much is certain. Whether it's directly related to Vickers' murder or something else entirely, you can't be sure. You press him again, asking if perhaps he went to the corner shop for milk, or even popped his head out the window. He denies it all, voice rising in pitch with each denial. He repeats himself over and over. You're not going to get anything else from him now, he has clammed up. He's clearly not going to admit to anything more tonight.

'Look, copper, you've got to understand the kind of bloke Vickers was. Everything he touched was bent. He said he was moving goods across the border, legitimately. He showed me contracts, things that looked legal, but I was a fool, and they were not! No paperwork was ever filed properly. No tax paid. It was all backhanders and nods. When it all went wrong, there was nothing I could do. No lawyer in the country would touch it without a clean paper trail, which of course, I did not have.' He shakes his head, a flicker of shame crossing his face. 'Going to the police? That would be admitting my own involvement in God knows what.' He seems genuinely stuck between losing his money and losing his freedom. At this point, you're less sure about his motives, but you are still not convinced that he is the killer. But you are running out of time, and this avenue is not bearing much fruit.

He opens his mouth to speak, then closes it again, his jaw working. The silence stretches, punctuated only by the hum of the fluorescent lights. You press him, but he offers nothing further. It's clear that while Arnold Price harboured intense resentment towards Peter Vickers, he's not the man you're after. The fire in his eyes is that of a victim, not a killer. The raw fury is born of desperation, not malice. He seems wrung out, a shadow of the man he once was. You feel as though further questioning will be fruitless. The man is broken, but not a murderer. He hated Vickers, for good reason, but you need to face facts: this is a dead end. You can't get blood from a stone.","choices":[{"entry_id":"interview_suspect_d_d016","content":"End the interview.

You pick up one of the photos. It shows Vickers, younger and somehow more hopeful-looking, standing with a woman and a young boy. Their smiles seem strained, the backdrop a faded seaside postcard cliché. Another photo depicts Vickers alone, clutching a fishing rod, a forced grin on his face. It looks like he tried to enjoy life, but it never seemed to come easy. A final photo displays a wedding photo, with the happy couple cutting a cake, a very young Hal McIntyre looking enviously at the food and drink. A life of crime was calling him even then, it seems. There's nothing here that screams 'murder clue,' but the photos offer a glimpse into the victim's past.

This could be the key to unlocking Vickers's shady dealings. Each page is filled with carefully recorded deposits and withdrawals, with references to offshore accounts and shell corporations. You gather the documents, placing them carefully into an evidence bag. As you step back outside into the unrelenting rain, you feel a surge of grim satisfaction.
