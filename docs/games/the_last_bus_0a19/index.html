<p class="prompt_text"><b>Prompt: </b>This is a choose your own adventure story where the player is stranded at a bus stop late at night, waiting for the last bus home. The bus stop itself is unremarkable, but as time passes, increasingly strange things begin to happen. The player encounters unusual characters, and the environment around the bus stop subtly shifts and changes. There is no clear or obvious objective; the player is simply trying to get home, but the journey becomes increasingly surreal and disorienting. The story should lean into the uncanny and create a sense of unease and mounting dread, but without resorting to jump scares or explicit horror. Consider exploring themes of isolation, displacement, and the fragility of reality.</p>

The fluorescent lights of the shelter hum, casting a sickly yellow glow on the surroundings. It's a standard setup – metal frame, glass panels, the usual smattering of teenage graffiti etched into the surface. Someone's scrawled 'The End is Nigh' in faded marker pen, but it looks more pathetic than threatening.\n\nThe posters are the usual fare: a slightly too-cheerful plumber promising 'No Leaks, Guaranteed!', a dry cleaner boasting 'Spotless Results!', and an advertisement for a dentist with a suspiciously wide, gleaming smile. I can smell faint exhaust fumes, mixed with the damp, metallic scent of rain that’s been threatening all evening. I really need to catch the 27. Missing it means a long, expensive taxi ride back to the suburbs, and I really can't afford that, or the questions I'll get when I get in.\n\nI pull my collar up against the chill and try to ignore the nagging feeling that I'm the only person for miles. The silence is broken only by the distant thrum of traffic and the occasional whoosh of a passing car. It probably sounds melodramatic but something about this place feels...wrong.

It's hard to be sure in the dim light, and maybe it's just the way the shadows are falling, but it definitely looks wrong. I blink rapidly, trying to clear my head. It must be my imagination.

A strange collection, even for this part of town. There's what looks like an antique shop, but the window display is overflowing with objects that appear to be made of bone – femurs, skulls, ribs, all polished and arranged like macabre ornaments. Next to it is a store with a simple, painted sign above the door that reads, 'The Shop'. No further explanation. The windows are dark and I can't see inside.

There was definitely something there, but what? A newsagent selling sweets and magazines? Maybe a bakery with the smell of fresh bread in the mornings?

It's not one big thing, but a collection of little things that don't quite add up. It's like a puzzle where the pieces almost fit, but not quite. The colours seem subtly off, and there's a hum in the air that I can't quite place. There's a disquieting feeling that I can't shake off, and a cold sweat breaks out on my skin. It's like being watched, but when I turn around, there's nothing there.","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e101","content":"Focus on the flickering streetlight.

It's almost like a heartbeat, or a slow, morose metronome. It casts long, dancing shadows that seem to writhe independently of the objects that should be casting them. The shadows twist and stretch, looking like grasping hands reaching out from the darkness, or maybe gnarled, skeletal fingers.","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e104","content":"Try to discern a pattern in the flickering. Is there a code?"}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e102":{"content":"The posters are the kind you see everywhere. 'Get a great rate on insurance!' one shouts, next to a picture of a smiling family. A local pizza place advertises two-for-one Tuesdays. Then there's one that throws me. It's blurred, indistinct, like a photo that's been photocopied too many times. The words 'Memory Reclamation Services' are printed across the top in a smudged font. Underneath is a swirling image, impossible to make out. It's not that it's overtly sinister, but it feels…off. Like a wrong note in a familiar song. The paper itself seems older, more brittle than the others, and the edges are peeling away from the backing board. I feel a strange pull towards it, like a half-forgotten dream trying to resurface.","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e105","content":"Read the advertisement about 'Memory Reclamation Services' more closely.

Focus on something normal."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e106":{"content":"I force myself to look at the insurance advertisement again. A smiling couple stands in front of a generic suburban house, but the image is subtly wrong. Their smiles are too wide, too fixed. The house looks strangely artificial, like a set from a cheap movie. And the slogan, 'Secure Your Tomorrow, Today!' feels…hollow. The colours seem too bright, and the shadows fall at unnatural angles. It's like looking at a photograph that's been digitally altered, but not quite convincingly. Even the font seems slightly different to ones I'm used to. I can't place what it is, though.","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e110","content":"Look for a different poster. I can't stand looking at that one any longer."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e110":{"content":"As I tear my gaze away from the unsettling insurance advert, I notice an old woman sitting on the bus stop bench. She wasn't there a moment ago, or maybe I just hadn't noticed her. She's staring directly at me, her eyes intense and knowing. She's knitting something with incredibly long needles, their silver points glinting in the dim light. What she's knitting is impossible to make out, obscured in a mass of tangled yarn, and the needles themselves seem to appear and disappear with each stitch. She has a small, knowing smile on her wrinkled face, as if she's waiting for me to speak.","choices":[{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_001","content":"Look at the old woman sitting on the bench more closely.

She smiles, a strange, unsettling smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. She’s still knitting, the needles clicking softly in the silence. 'Lost, are we?' she asks, her voice raspy but clear. 'Or perhaps merely misplaced?' Do I humor her strange pronouncements, or dismiss her as just another senile old lady, muttering to herself? She seems to be waiting for me to respond.","choices":[{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_002","content":"Humor her and listen to her riddles. Maybe she knows something."},{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_003","content":"Dismiss her as senile and ignore her.

Perhaps a direct question will yield a direct answer."}],"end":null},"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_002":{"content":"She chuckles, a dry, rustling sound like leaves skittering across pavement. 'Ah, curiosity,' she says. 'A dangerous path, but sometimes the only one worth taking.' Then she says, 'The path home is paved with yesterday's regrets, yet the carriage of tomorrow awaits. Only the number knows the way, but the reflection hides the truth.' Her gaze intensifies. 'Do you understand?' The words hang in the air, heavy with unspoken meaning. It's nonsense, of course, but a shiver runs down my spine nonetheless. Is it worth trying to write it down to analyze later?","choices":[{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_004","content":"Try to decipher the riddle about the bus route.

The screen flickers to life, displaying the time: 11:51 PM. Still no sign of the 27. I try to load the bus app, but the signal is weak, the loading bar crawling at a snail's pace. Then the bar turns red and seems to slide backwards. Frustratingly, the signal strength keeps fluctuating; from one bar, to zero, then back again.

It might just be a slow connection."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e107":{"content":"The bus app is definitely glitching now. I tap the screen repeatedly, but no updates are available for the 27. Instead of the route map, or even an error message, I'm faced with a screen of static, like an old TV tuned to a dead channel. It's unsettling. I try closing the app and reopening it, but the static remains, buzzing faintly. The chill on my neck grows colder. This isn't normal. I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched. Maybe it's just stress from work; I should focus on something else to distract myself.","choices":[{"entry_id":"mundane_loop_m001","content":"Continue to refresh the app, hoping it will eventually load."}],"end":null},"mundane_loop_m001":{"content":"I try to ignore the growing feeling that something is profoundly wrong, attempting to explain it away as tiredness or stress. I focus my attention on my phone again, trying to distract myself with the mundane surroundings of the bus stop. The graffiti on the glass, the flickering streetlight, the peeling paint on the bus shelter – anything to avoid acknowledging the unease creeping up my spine.

The battery percentage seems to have dropped significantly since the last time I checked, which couldn't have been more than a few minutes ago. It's down to 67%. I scroll through the news headlines, but the articles seem strangely irrelevant and distant, like they're happening in another world. The news is the same as it was an hour ago; the same political squabbles, the same celebrity gossip, the same reports of distant tragedies. I'm finding it hard to connect with any of it. It all seems so meaningless here.","choices":[{"entry_id":"mundane_loop_m004","content":"Try to focus and read an article online.

But now, as I try to read, the words seem to swim before my eyes, blurring and shifting on the screen. It's hard to concentrate. The sentences are long and convoluted, filled with jargon and technical terms that I can't quite grasp. It's like the article is deliberately trying to confuse me, or like I am having trouble remembering simple words. The screen dims and brightens intermittently, as if the phone is struggling to function properly. I can't seem to focus on what's happening for more than a few seconds. A strange feeling that I've read it before washes over me.","choices":[{"entry_id":"mundane_loop_m008","content":"Reread the article from the beginning, hoping to make sense of it this time."},{"entry_id":"mundane_loop_m009","content":"Give up on the article and check the time.

The pattern is definitely there, a distinct rhythm of short and long bursts of light. It feels like I'm on the verge of understanding something important, a hidden message encoded in the streetlight's dance. My heart pounds in my chest, and I find myself holding my breath. There's a strange buzzing in my ears, almost like static, but quieter, deeper, like the earth is humming. Each flicker seems to resonate within me, amplifying the sense of unease that's been building since I arrived. The air crackles with a strange energy, and I can almost taste metal on my tongue.

The bus stop feels different now. It's not just an ordinary place with minor imperfections. It's radiating wrongness. The flickering streetlight seems to pulse with a deliberate rhythm, like a dying heart. The colours in the plumber's poster have deepened, becoming lurid and unsettling. And there's a distortion in my peripheral vision, a subtle warping of the edges of the world. The metallic tang of the air is sharper, almost like blood.

I can make out fragments: 'Memory...' 'Reclamation...' 'Service...' What does that even mean? A shiver runs down my spine. The air around the poster feels colder, heavier.

The promise of reclaiming lost memories hangs there, tempting and terrifying. I glance down the road, and for a split second, I think I see the 27 bus approaching, its headlights cutting through the gloom.

But they're all jumbled and distorted, like broken pieces of a shattered mirror. I try to grasp onto something solid, something familiar, but it slips through my fingers like sand.

The image is so blurred it's almost abstract, like staring into swirling smoke. I think I can make out faces in there, but they shift and change as I try to focus, like looking at clouds. The text is equally vague, promising to 'restore fragmented recollections' and 'rebuild lost narratives'. It all sounds unsettling, like a sinister promise wrapped in marketing jargon. There's a phone number at the bottom, printed in a smaller font. It's a local area code, but the last four digits...they seem familiar, like a number I used to know.
