<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>This is a choose your own adventure story where the player is stranded at a bus stop late at night, waiting for the last bus home. The bus stop itself is unremarkable, but as time passes, increasingly strange things begin to happen. The player encounters unusual characters, and the environment around the bus stop subtly shifts and changes. There is no clear or obvious objective; the player is simply trying to get home, but the journey becomes increasingly surreal and disorienting. The story should lean into the uncanny and create a sense of unease and mounting dread, but without resorting to jump scares or explicit horror. Consider exploring themes of isolation, displacement, and the fragility of reality.</p>

Missing it means a long, expensive taxi ride, and a lot of explaining to do. The bus shelter is the usual kind, all metal and glass, with the predictable smattering of graffiti – mostly names and dates, quickly scrawled. A couple of posters are plastered to the back, advertising the kind of businesses you see everywhere: 'Dave's Plumbing - No Job Too Small!' and 'Sparkle Cleaners - We Get the Dirt Others Miss!' There’s even one for a dentist, Dr. Bloom, with a slightly too-wide, unsettlingly perfect smile. The street itself is quiet. Just the distant hum of traffic from the main road, and the occasional car hissing past. The air smells faintly of exhaust fumes, mixed with that damp, earthy smell that always comes before rain. \n\nI sigh and shift my weight, feeling the familiar ache in my feet. I should have worn more comfortable shoes. I pull out my phone to check for updates, but the signal's weak.

The metal frame is cold under my fingertips. The paper inside is aged, yellowed and peeling away at the corners. It’s also been heavily vandalized. Thick black marker pen has been used to cross out nearly all the scheduled times, leaving only a chaotic mess of ink. It looks like someone was really angry about something, but it's impossible to tell what time the 27 is even supposed to come, if it's even running at all.","choices":[{"entry_id":"arrival_at_bus_stop_e004","content":"Try to decipher the timetable anyway."},{"entry_id":"arrival_at_bus_stop_e005","content":"Give up on the timetable and just wait, it's useless."}],"end":null},"arrival_at_bus_stop_e004":{"content":"I squint at the timetable, trying to make some sense of the chaotic mess of overlapping numbers and smeared ink. The light from the streetlamp flickers intermittently, making it even harder to see. There are layers of writing on top of each other, like palimpsests of forgotten schedules. I trace a finger across the page, feeling the raised texture of the dried ink. Among the mess, I can just make out the number '27', scrawled in a shaky hand. Below that is a series of times that seem to jump around randomly - 12:15, 1:42, 11:58. None of them seem to follow any logical order.

Despite the aggressive vandalism, the bus route number is still legible, printed in a bold, official font. '27' it reads. At least I'm at the right stop. A small comfort, but I'll take what I can get. Now, if only I could figure out when the damn thing is actually supposed to arrive.

It's clearly useless. I'll simply wait and hope the bus arrives soon. I shift my weight from one foot to the other, feeling the chill of the night air seep through my thin jacket. A shiver runs down my spine. I wish I'd worn something warmer. I wrap my arms around myself, trying to conserve heat. The streetlights hum overhead, casting long, distorted shadows that dance around the edges of my vision. There's a weird smell in the air, too, something metallic and acrid, like ozone after a lightning strike. Or old blood.","choices":[{"entry_id":"arrival_at_bus_stop_e009","content":"Notice something subtly wrong about the scene and try to dismiss it as my imagination."}],"end":null},"arrival_at_bus_stop_e009":{"content":"Something about the scene feels subtly, unsettlingly off. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's a sense of wrongness that prickles at the back of my neck. I look at the advertising posters again. The poster for 'Sparkle Cleaners' shows the same smiling woman holding a mop. But now, the mop looks to be dripping black tar, and the smile seems wider, almost manic. I try to dismiss it as a trick of the light, or simply my tired eyes playing tricks on me. I'm probably just stressed and overtired. That must be it.","choices":[{"entry_id":"arrival_at_bus_stop_e002","content":"Check the bus timetable again, anything is worth a try."}],"end":null},"arrival_at_bus_stop_e003":{"content":"Across the street, the row of shops is barely visible in the dim, orange glow of the streetlights. They look closed, of course, but there’s something odd about them, something that pulls my attention. One seems to be an antique shop, crammed full of objects that gleam faintly – and, now that I look closer, they seem to be fashioned from bone. The next shop over is simply called 'The Shop,' its sign plain and unremarkable. The last storefront is completely dark, except for the faint blue light emanating from within. It's filled with old televisions, dozens of them stacked haphazardly, all displaying nothing but static. A faint, almost inaudible buzzing sound drifts from them.","choices":[{"entry_id":"arrival_at_bus_stop_e006","content":"Try to remember what shops were there before."},{"entry_id":"arrival_at_bus_stop_e007","content":"Ignore the shops and focus on the bus."}],"end":null},"arrival_at_bus_stop_e006":{"content":"I squint, trying to jog my memory. What used to be there? I'm sure there was a newsagent on the corner, with the smell of fresh pastries wafting from somewhere nearby... A bakery, maybe? Or was that further down the street? The memories feel slippery, like trying to grasp smoke. They're there, but I can't quite focus on them. The more I try, the more the images blur, replaced by a vague unease. It's frustrating, this feeling of something just out of reach.","choices":[{"entry_id":"arrival_at_bus_stop_e007","content":"Try to get a better look at the bone artifacts."},{"entry_id":"arrival_at_bus_stop_e007","content":"Try to get a better look at the televisions."}],"end":null},"arrival_at_bus_stop_e007":{"content":"I shake my head, trying to clear the fog. It's late, and I'm letting my imagination run wild. Tiredness can do strange things to you. The shops are probably just closed, and I'm misremembering things. The only thing that matters is catching the 27. I need to get home. I take a seat on the cold metal bench, the chill seeping through my clothes. I pull my jacket tighter around me and try to focus on the road, willing the bus to appear.","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e100","content":"Shake off the feeling and wait for the bus."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e100":{"content":"Sitting here, I can't shake the feeling that something's not right. Everything *looks* normal, but there's a subtle discordance, a disharmony that prickles at the back of my neck. The posters, for example – Dr. Bloom's unsettling smile seems wider, somehow more predatory. And wasn't the 'Sparkle Cleaners' poster a different colour before? It's hard to say for sure. Even the shadows seem to be behaving strangely, stretching and contorting in ways that don't quite match the objects casting them. It's probably just the poor lighting, but still…","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e101","content":"Focus on the flickering streetlight."},{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e102","content":"Examine the posters more closely."},{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e103","content":"Try to ignore the feeling and check your phone."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e101":{"content":"The streetlight above flickers with an erratic rhythm, as if controlled by a faulty heartbeat. It plunges the bus stop into alternating pools of light and shadow. The shadows are the worst part. They lengthen and distort, stretching across the pavement like grasping fingers, reaching out as if to pull me into the darkness. For a moment, I could swear I saw one detach completely from its source, writhing independently before snapping back into place as the light returned. It felt distinctly unnatural, as if the shadows possessed a life of their own.","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e104","content":"Try to discern a pattern in the flickering."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e102":{"content":"The posters are the usual mix of local ads. Dave's Plumbing, Dr. Bloom's Dentistry, but something feels off. I focus on them one by one. Dave's Plumbing looks normal. Dr. Bloom's smile still seems a bit too wide. But then my eyes land on one I don't remember seeing before. It's faded and blurry, like it's been rained on a thousand times, advertising something called 'Memory Reclamation Services'. The phone number is smudged and illegible, and the image is just a swirling grey vortex. The more I look at it, the more uneasy I feel, like a forgotten word is on the tip of my tongue.","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e105","content":"Read the advertisement about 'Memory Reclamation Services' more carefully."},{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e106","content":"Inspect the advertisement for a mundane product, like Dr. Bloom's Dentistry."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e106":{"content":"I turn my attention to the Dr. Bloom's Dentistry poster, trying to find something normal to focus on. It depicts a smiling, perfect family – too perfect, now that I'm really looking. The father's eyes seem to gleam with an unnatural light, and the mother's smile is fixed, almost strained. Below them, the slogan reads: 'Dr. Bloom: We Make Smiles Last Forever.' But something about the 'forever' is unsettling, like it's not just referring to dental health. The background, too, seems subtly wrong; the colors are too bright, the perspective slightly skewed.","choices":[{"entry_id":"initial_anomalies_e110","content":"Look for a different poster - anything that feels more real."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e110":{"content":"I force myself to look away from the unsettling perfection of the dentistry advertisement. As I scan the bus stop again, I notice an old woman sitting on the bench at the far end. I hadn't seen her before. She's huddled in on herself, her face obscured by a knitted shawl. Her hands move with a strange, almost frantic energy, manipulating knitting needles that seem to shimmer in and out of existence. She is looking directly at me, or perhaps through me.","choices":[{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_001","content":"Look more closely at the old woman sitting on the bench."}],"end":null},"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_001":{"content":"As I focus on her, the old woman slowly lifts her head. Her eyes, framed by wrinkles and shadows, are surprisingly sharp and knowing. A faint smile plays on her lips, a smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. 'Lost, are we?' she rasps, her voice like dry leaves skittering across pavement. 'Or perhaps merely... misplaced?' She resumes her knitting, the needles clicking softly in the night air. The question hangs between us, heavy and unsettling. Is she just a harmless old woman, or something more?","choices":[{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_002","content":"Humor her and listen to what she has to say."},{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_003","content":"Dismiss her as senile and turn away."},{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_012","content":"Ask what she's knitting so intently."}],"end":null},"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_002":{"content":"She pauses her knitting for a moment, her eyes fixed on some unseen point beyond me. 'The path home is paved with yesterday's regrets,' she says, her voice a low murmur, 'yet the carriage of tomorrow awaits. Only the number knows the way, but the reflection hides the truth.' She looks back at me, her gaze intense. 'Write it down, child. Forgetting is the greatest curse of all.' Then, as suddenly as she stopped, she resumes her knitting, the needles flashing in the dim light.","choices":[{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_004","content":"Try to decipher the riddle about the bus route - what could she mean by 'the number' and 'the reflection'?"},{"entry_id":"old_woman_encounter_old_woman_005","content":"Ask her to speak plainly - I don't have time for riddles."}],"end":null},"initial_anomalies_e103":{"content":"I pull out my phone, hoping to distract myself from this growing unease.

The light is making it hard to see. It's definitely not the same one I saw before, or maybe ever. The colours are jarring, clashing in a way that makes my stomach churn.

It smells of ozone and something vaguely chemical.","choices":[{"entry_id":"heightened_awareness_ha004","content":"Focus on the specific changes in the poster."},{"entry_id":"heightened_awareness_ha003","content":"Look away, the poster is giving me a headache."}],"end":null},"heightened_awareness_ha004":{"content":"I squint, straining to decipher the message and failing to recall what was there before. The poster has definitely changed - the wording is different and the image is distorted. The main text now reads 'Memory Reclamation Service - We Can Help You Remember'. Beneath that, in smaller print, is an address I don't recognise and a phone number that seems to have one too many digits. A picture dominates the poster - a blurry, indistinct face that seems vaguely familiar, yet completely alien. I am struggling to reconcile these facts. And, in my peripheral vision, I swear I can see the 27 bus has appeared down the road, although it's too far to make out any details. Perhaps it is time to take stock of where I am, to try to regain some sense of control.","choices":[{"entry_id":"heightened_awareness_ha007","content":"Try to remember what the poster looked like before."},{"entry_id":"questioning_reality_qr001","content":"Give up trying to understand it."}],"end":null},"heightened_awareness_ha007":{"content":"The more I try to remember, the more confused I become. Fragments of different images and phrases flash through my mind: Dr. Bloom's impossibly white teeth, a blurry advertisement for plumbing services, the words 'Sparkle Cleaners'. They are all jumbled.

The swirling vortex image makes my head spin if I stare too long. The font is a weird, scratchy typeface that looks like it was drawn by hand. The promise of restoring lost memories is tempting, but something about the wording is off, a subtle hint that these 'services' might come at a steep price. It says 'We can help you remember... everything'. The phone number, now that I look closer, has the local area code, but the last four digits seem oddly familiar.

The call connects, but instead of a ringtone, I hear a burst of static, followed by a low, rhythmic pulse, like a muffled heartbeat. A strange, almost subliminal message seems to be buried in the static. I can't quite make out the words, but it feels like a question, directed at me. I feel a tingling sensation in my fingertips, and a wave of nausea washes over me. Then, the line goes dead.

I blink, trying to regain my bearings, but it's no use. It's like I've stepped into a slightly altered version of the same reality. Why did I call that number? What was I hoping to find?

His face is flushed crimson, sweat beading on his brow, and his voice is rising in pitch. He's gesticulating wildly, pointing towards the street as if he's seeing someone that isn't there.

The static intensifies, filling my entire being. My thoughts, my memories, my very sense of self… it all dissolves into the white noise. There is nothing left but the hum, a pure, unadulterated vibration that resonates through every atom of my being. The world outside is gone, replaced by an endless expanse of static. The terror I thought I would feel never materialises. There is a strange sense of calm, of completion. I am no longer an individual, but part of something larger, something infinite. My individuality is a drop of water falling into the ocean. My memories feel like echoes of echoes, never truly mine. I was never at the bus stop. I was never going home. There is only the hum.

The bus stop seems to pulse with a newfound energy, a vibrant hum that resonates deep within my bones. A feeling of integration, not of lostness, washes over me.

Her skin is too smooth, like polished porcelain, and her hair is arranged in a style that feels both archaic and futuristic at the same time. It's a perfect helmet of black, reflecting the dim light. What really throws me, though, is her lack of eyebrows. It gives her face an unsettlingly blank quality.

It’s like a half-remembered nursery rhyme, but twisted somehow. The phrase seems to hang in the air, vibrating with an unnatural energy.

I can see bizarre place names flickering on the screen: 'Nowheresville', 'Memory Lane', and 'The Unsea'.

The question chills me. 'Are you awake?' It echoes in my mind, sounding oddly familiar, like something from a half-forgotten nightmare.

It feels familiar, like a half-remembered dream. The wall itself begins to crumble further, the wrought iron spikes bending and twisting into grotesque shapes.
