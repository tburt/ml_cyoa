A song you half-recognize bleeds from the cheap transistor radio beside the bed, fighting for airspace with the clock's racket. Marlene is curled up next to you, her face pressed into the pillow, breathing softly. The room is shadowy, the curtains doing little to hold back the dull grey light seeping in from outside. You can feel the familiar ache in your joints, the dampness clinging to the room, the low feeling in your stomach, just like any other Monday since you were laid off. The smell of last night's supper lingers faintly in the air.\n\nYou know you should get up. Marlene needs to get to her cleaning job. The day stretches ahead of you: the Job Centre, another fruitless search for work, the same conversations with the same faces down at the Dog & Trumpet.

You're surrounded by familiar faces, the air thick with the smell of oil and cotton. Foreman Bradshaw is shouting something, but you can't quite make out what he's saying. He points at a faulty machine, his face red with anger. Then the scene shifts, and you're standing outside the factory gates, a 'CLOSED' sign hanging on the door.

Besides, those surgeries are full of germs. I'm better off here.' She turns her face to the wall, effectively ending the conversation. You can tell she's genuinely upset, but the worry gnaws at you.

Your mind starts racing, going over the bills, the job applications, Marlene's cough. You drift in and out of consciousness, half-dreaming, half-worrying. When you finally jolt awake again, the sun is much higher in the sky. A quick glance at the clock confirms your worst fears: it's almost ten. Marlene will be furious if she knew. You've definitely missed any chance of getting to the Job Centre early. There's no time for breakfast now, or anything else for that matter.

You walk with a determined stride, hoping to at least get there before the worst of the queue forms. You pass Mrs. Patel's shop, the smell of frying onions wafting out, making your stomach rumble again. You resist the urge to stop and get a sausage roll.

The peeling paint and flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows, making everyone look even more glum. You recognise a few of the blokes - the unlucky faces that always seem to be there, week in, week out. You spot Barry Nelson, Tommy 'Knuckles' Nelson's older brother, looking even more shifty than usual. Old Tom, from number 12, is clutching his dog-eared card.

The conversation turns, as it always does, to the lack of jobs and the uselessness of the government. He complains about immigrants taking all the work, but then quickly backtracks, muttering something about not meaning anything by it.

Your stomach rumbles as you head towards the front door, grabbing your cap from the peg. \"See you later, Marlene,\" you call out, but she's already halfway through the living room door, lugging her heavy bucket. She simply raises a hand in acknowledgment, a flicker of annoyance still in her eyes. You feel a pang of guilt, knowing she's relying on you to find work, but the thought of facing Brenda at the Job Centre on an empty stomach doesn't improve your mood either.

You manage a weak smile in return, crumbs sticking to your fingers. \"Aye, Marlene needed to leave early today\", you tell her, before quickly saying goodbye and heading towards the door.

You decide to head to Grimshaw Park, hoping Buster might have wandered there in search of open space and some squirrels. It's a bit of a walk, but the thought of old Harrison cheered up spurs you on. You imagine him alone in his house, missing his furry companion. The least you can do is take a look around the park. You leave the alley and start heading towards the park gates, the sound of your footsteps echoing on the damp pavement.","choices":[{"entry_id":"lost_dog_search_ld011","content":"Head towards the park to search for the dog."}],"end":null},"dog_returned_dog002":{"content":"You knock on the door, and after a moment, it's opened by Harrison himself. His face is etched with worry, and his eyes are red-rimmed. You simply gesture to Buster, who's wagging his tail tentatively, peeking out from behind your legs. Harrison's face crumples with relief. 'Buster!' he cries, his voice thick with emotion. He drops to his knees, engulfing the dog in a hug. He looks up at you, tears welling in his eyes. 'Thank you,' he croaks, 'Thank you so much. I don't know what I'd do without him.' He seems genuinely relieved and grateful. He invites you inside for a cup of tea.

Buster barks happily as you pat him one last time, his fur rough under your hand. As you walk away, you can hear Harrison talking to the dog in a low, comforting voice.

You feel a need for a newspaper to read and a small distraction from your thoughts. Perhaps Mrs. Patel will have some interesting gossip to share, and might be more appreciative. You wander down Primrose Street, feeling a little deflated, and enter Patel's Corner Shop, the bell above the door jingling as you enter. Mrs. Patel is behind the counter, reading a newspaper, her spectacles perched on the end of her nose.

It's not a welcoming place; the grass is overgrown and the flowerbeds are full of weeds. Even on a good day, the park feels neglected, and today is far from good. You can't shake the feeling that Buster wouldn't come here anyway. It's a grim place for a dog. You think about Harrison, but the cold reality of your own situation weighs on you. What's the point? You need to focus on yourself, on finding some way to make ends meet. The grey sky seems to press down on you, mirroring the familiar feeling of hopelessness that settles in your stomach. You turn away from the park, the image of the canal a more appealing prospect, even if only slightly. At least it's something to do.","choices":[{"entry_id":"canal_contemplation_canal_001","content":"Give up the search for the dog, feeling a familiar sense of hopelessness, and walk along the canal bank instead."}],"end":null},"fight_outcome_f004":{"content":"You force the words out, even though they stick in your throat like a bad cough.

You clench your fists, fighting back the urge to turn around and lash out, but you know it would only make things worse. Best to go home, lick your wounds.

Tommy stands over you, raining down blows, each one a hammer blow of pain. You try to shield your face, but it's no use. Darkness closes in, and you lose consciousness.

He doesn't let up, raining down blows on you. You go down hard onto the pavement, unable to defend yourself. He keeps kicking and punching, his face contorted with rage.

He curls up on the grimy pavement, clutching his side and groaning. The small crowd begins to disperse, their bloodlust satisfied. You stand over him for a moment, chest heaving, feeling a wave of nausea wash over you. The adrenaline is already fading, replaced by a cold, hard shame. You turn and walk away, not wanting to see the looks on their faces, or Tommy's. The taste of blood and regret lingers in your mouth.

You nod, relieved to avoid a fight, but now burdened by the added pressure of owing Tommy Nelson money.
