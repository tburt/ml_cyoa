The last thing you remember is being jostled in the throng of the Midnight Madness sale at Meadowbrook Mall, the press of bodies and the flashing lights of temporary sales signs overwhelming you. Now, the fluorescent lights are off, replaced by the faint, eerie glow of emergency exit signs. The once-bustling corridors are silent, and the air is thick with the smell of stale popcorn and something indefinably…metallic. \n\nYou are alone. The heavy glass doors of the mall entrance loom ahead, but something feels off. The layout seems subtly different, stores appearing where you don't remember them being. A shiver of unease creeps up your neck. Your plan was simple: find that coffee machine Eleanor wanted at Kitchen Kingdom. But now, simply finding a way out seems a more pressing concern.\n\nYou stand and brush off your coat, the silence broken only by the distant hum of the mall's ventilation system. A sign above the darkened entrance reads 'Meadowbrook Mall - We've got it all!'.

The stores seem subtly wrong. A 'Foot Locker' is now where you remember 'The Gap' being. A poster in the window shows Michael Jordan in an ancient pair of sneakers. It feels like the mall is resisting your attempts to find a way out, twisting familiar landmarks into something unsettling and alien. The further you walk, the more disoriented you become.","choices":[{"content":"Head towards the mall lobby and food court, hoping to find an exit.","entry_id":"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e001"}],"end":null},"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e001":{"entry_id":"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e001","content":"You find yourself in the mall lobby. The once-gleaming floor is now scuffed and littered with discarded flyers. Ahead is the entrance to the food court. The smell of old grease hangs heavy in the air. At the far end, near the defunct Vanity Fair counter, you see a woman. She is pale and seems to be frantically searching for something, her hands flitting nervously across the dusty surface. She is muttering to herself.","choices":[{"content":"Approach Clara and ask if she needs help.","entry_id":"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e002"},{"content":"Ignore her and try to find Kitchen Kingdom.","entry_id":"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e003"}],"end":null},"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e002":{"entry_id":"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e002","content":"The woman turns to you, her eyes wide and pleading.

The sound bounces off the darkened storefronts and the deserted food court tables. Your voice cracks with the strain. There is no response. The silence returns, heavier now, pressing in on you from all sides. A flickering emergency light casts long, distorted shadows that dance on the walls. The metallic smell seems stronger now, almost like blood.","choices":[{"content":"Try to find a familiar exit, again.","entry_id":"mall_entrance_e001"}],"end":null},"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e003":{"entry_id":"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e003","content":"You try to ignore Clara. You tell yourself it's none of your business, that you have your own problems to deal with. The fluorescent lights flicker erratically, casting long, distorted shadows. The air grows cold, and a low, mournful wail echoes from the deserted arcade. The silence becomes oppressive, and a feeling of profound despair washes over you. You realise the exits seem to have disappeared, replaced by endless corridors lined with identical, shuttered stores. You are trapped.","choices":[],"end":"lose"},"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e005":{"entry_id":"mall_lobby_and_food_court_e005","content":"Clara's face changes. She says you don't get it.

They advertise various beauty products: blushers, mascaras, nail polishes, but nothing about 'Crimson Sunset'. However, you find a crumpled memo on faded pink paper referencing a dispute. It's between Agnes Plumtree, the store manager, and the cosmetics company 'Bella France' over a discontinued ingredient.

You find several shades of red, but none are quite right. The closest you find is a 'Ruby Tuesday' shade, but it's too bright and lacks the subtle shimmer Clara mentioned. The air is thick with the ghostly scent of cheap perfume and the faint, metallic tang of old lipstick. You feel a growing sense of unease; the mall feels like it's watching you.","choices":[{"content":"Search the back room for anything related to Agnes Plumtree.","entry_id":"vanity_fair_search_e007"},{"content":"Accept that you are lost in Vanity Fair.","entry_id":"vanity_fair_search_e006"}],"end":null},"vanity_fair_search_e007":{"entry_id":"vanity_fair_search_e007","content":"You find a dusty file labeled \",","choices":[{"content":"Investigate the mall management office.","entry_id":"ashland_office_e001"}],"end":null},"kitchen_kingdom_regret_e002":{"entry_id":"kitchen_kingdom_regret_e002","content":"You carefully place the coffee machine on the counter and pay for it, your hands trembling slightly. The cashier's long-gone, but the till is working, somehow. As you pick up the machine, a sense of peace washes over you, a feeling that you’ve finally honored Eleanor's memory.
