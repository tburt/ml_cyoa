<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>This is a choose your own adventure story set entirely within the context of a washing machine and its immediate surroundings (a utility room, bathroom or kitchen). The story revolves around the increasingly strange discoveries you make regarding missing socks and other items disappearing inside the machine. Whilst you start with a goal of trying to fix the machine, a surreal mystery unfolds. The tone should be one of domestic mundanity slowly giving way to the unsettling. The goal isn&#39;t horror or comedy, but something strangely *other*.</p>

Before you lies a jumbled heap of orphaned socks, a testament to the escalating laundry crisis. The floral wallpaper, once vibrant, now peels at the edges, revealing patches of faded plaster beneath. The linoleum floor, patterned with faux-tiles, is cold and slightly damp under your feet. A low, rhythmic hum emanates from the corner, a sound you've grown accustomed to, but today, it grates on your nerves.\n\n      It started subtly, just a missing sock here and there. You'd find lone socks tucked away in strange places – behind the radiator, under the sofa – always assuming a simple case of misplacement. But the disappearances have become more frequent, more… systematic. Now, after every wash, a significant number vanish, swallowed by some unseen force. The logical explanations – static cling, clumsy folding – no longer suffice. A disquieting feeling settles over you, a sense that something is profoundly wrong.\n\n      Your gaze falls upon the Whirlwind 2000, a front-loading washing machine that dominates the far corner of the room. Its stainless steel door reflects the harsh light, casting long, distorted shadows. It sits silent, an inscrutable metallic presence, yet you can't shake the feeling that it holds the answer, or perhaps, is the source of the problem. You remember the day you bought it. The salesman promised efficiency and quiet operation. Now, you're not so sure.","choices":[{"entry_id":"kitchen_start_k002","content":"Take a deep breath and meticulously count the socks.

Spreading the heap of socks across the cool linoleum floor, you begin the meticulous task of sorting. Stripes are separated from solids, cotton from wool, ankle socks from knee-highs. It's a strangely calming process, a temporary distraction from the unsettling truth that looms: socks don't just vanish. \n\nBut as you delve deeper, the task becomes less soothing and more disturbing. The sheer number of single socks is alarming. Where once you might have found one or two strays, now entire sets are incomplete. The colors, too, seem off, somehow muted and faded. And then there are the textures – rough patches where the fabric should be smooth, threadbare spots that appear almost deliberate. After what feels like hours, you finish the count. The results are conclusive: eighteen socks have gone missing in the last week alone, an undeniable escalation.","choices":[{"entry_id":"kitchen_start_k005","content":"Methodically pair the socks..."}],"end":null},"kitchen_start_k005":{"content":"The methodical process of pairing only serves to heighten your anxiety. Each matched pair is a small victory, a brief respite from the growing sense of unease. But the sheer number of single socks is disturbing, mocking you with their incompleteness. This goes beyond simple laundry mishaps or absentmindedness. \n\nIt’s become clear that a decision must be made. You can’t ignore this any longer. Something is happening, and the Whirlwind 2000 washing machine in the corner of the room is likely at the center of it. It's time to face the cold, unblinking eye of the appliance and uncover the source of this domestic anomaly.","choices":[{"entry_id":"investigate_washer_e100","content":"Examine the Whirlwind 2000 for clues..."}],"end":null},"investigate_washer_e100":{"content":"You stand before the Whirlwind 2000, a cold dread washing over you. It's a mixture of grim determination and simmering apprehension. The appliance hums quietly, a subtle vibration felt through the soles of your feet. The missing socks are no longer just a minor annoyance; they're an escalating enigma, a problem that needs solving. The feeling of wrongness needs to have an answer. \n\nThe Whirlwind 2000 is a standard model, purchased five years ago from a local appliance store. The stainless steel door reflects your own worried face back at you. The digital display panel flickers erratically, the usual numbers replaced by strange, alien symbols that seem to shift and change with each passing moment. A faint, acrid smell of ozone hangs in the air, a ghostly reminder of some unseen electrical discharge. This isn't normal. Washing machines aren't supposed to smell like this. \n\nPerhaps there's a logical explanation – a loose wire, a faulty sensor, a build-up of static electricity. Or perhaps something far more sinister is at play. Either way, the socks are disappearing, and it's up to you to discover where they're going. The fate of your wardrobe, and your sanity, may depend on it.","choices":[{"entry_id":"investigate_washer_e101","content":"Examine the Whirlwind 2000 more closely for any external damage."},{"entry_id":"investigate_washer_e102","content":"Attempt to understand why the socks are vanishing by researching washing machine mishaps."},{"entry_id":"investigate_washer_e103","content":"Try an unorthodox appliance appeasement ritual."},{"entry_id":"investigate_washer_e104","content":"Consider if the socks are *really* vanishing, and check all the usual spots."}],"end":null},"investigate_washer_e101":{"content":"You decide a closer inspection of the Whirlwind 2000 is warranted. Bending down, you run your hand along the cool, slightly grimy metal casing. There's a faint vibration, a low thrumming that seems to resonate from deep within its workings. It's a subtle sound, easily dismissed, but tonight it feels amplified, almost purposeful. \n\nThe digital display flickers erratically, displaying a series of symbols that resemble ancient runes more than standard error codes. You make a note of the sequence: a looping spiral, an inverted triangle, and what looks like a stylized eye. These symbols are new; you've never seen them before. Are they a warning? An invitation? Or simply the result of a malfunctioning circuit board? The machine certainly doesn't appear to be operating normally.\n\nFocusing on the physical aspects of the machine seems like a reasonable approach. Maybe a loose connection or a blocked filter is to blame.

They have to be connected to something, and a leak or blockage could explain some of the strange behavior of the Whirlwind 2000. You crouch down behind the machine, the damp floor chilling you through your socks. The hoses, a grey corrugated plastic, are secured to the wall and the machine with metal clamps. \n\nAs you examine the connections, you notice something odd. One of the hoses, the one leading to the drain, seems newer than the others. It's a different shade of grey, and the plastic feels less rigid. On closer inspection, you see faint, almost imperceptible scratches on the surface, as if something has been repeatedly scraping against it from the inside. A growing unease settles over you. This isn't a simple plumbing issue.","choices":[{"entry_id":"strange_modifications_sm001","content":"Grab your tools and begin dismantling the hoses."},{"entry_id":"investigate_washer_e113","content":"Give up and go back."}],"end":null},"kitchen_start_k003":{"content":"You maintain a 'sock graveyard' in a dusty corner of the kitchen. It's not a literal graveyard, but a corkboard plastered with single socks, each impaled with a pushpin like some bizarre entomological collection. The once-colourful socks now appear faded under the kitchen's harsh light, their elastics drooping slightly with age and neglect. The board itself is overflowing; a silent, woollen accusation aimed squarely at the Whirlwind 2000. \n\nThe absurdity of it all isn't lost on you. The initial amusement at a few missing socks has long since evaporated, replaced by a creeping sense of unease. It's not just the socks, either. Other small items have disappeared recently – a favourite pen, a set of keys, even spare change seems to vanish into thin air. You wonder if they too will end up on the board.","choices":[{"entry_id":"kitchen_start_k006","content":"Add the most recent loss to the memorial..."}],"end":null},"kitchen_start_k006":{"content":"You solemnly pin the latest casualty to the board, a brightly striped sock now separated from its mate. The pin pierces the fabric with a soft 'thwack', joining the throng of lost souls. The sheer volume of missing socks is undeniable. The colourful stripes add to the overwhelming sensation. \n\nNext to the board, you glance at a hastily drawn chart showing an exponential increase in missing socks over the past two weeks. The graph line shoots upwards like a feverish heartbeat. This can't be a coincidence. The numbers don't lie. Resigned, you turn to the Whirlwind 2000. It's time to stop documenting the problem and start investigating the source. Maybe the machine itself holds the answer.","choices":[{"entry_id":"investigate_washer_e100","content":"Turn to the Whirlwind 2000..."}],"end":null},"investigate_washer_e102":{"content":"Instead of leaping into action, you pause to consider the possibilities.

You read about sock gnomes, interdimensional laundry chutes, and even sentient washing machines with a taste for cotton blends.\n\nThe Whirlwind 2000 sits silently in the corner of your eye. It is silent, judging. \n\nYour search leads you to some options, but you must proceed with caution.

The water boils, its whistle momentarily drowning out the rhythmic hum emanating from the corner of the room. You pour the steaming water over the tea bag, the fragrant steam rising to meet your face. \n\nBut even as you stir the tea, adding a splash of milk and a spoonful of sugar, your gaze keeps drifting back to the Whirlwind 2000. The stainless steel door gleams under the harsh light, a silent sentinel guarding its secrets. The random characters flashing on its digital display seem to mock your attempt at normalcy. \n\nThe feeling of wrongness persists, a nagging unease that no amount of tea can wash away. It's time to face the Whirlwind 2000, to confront the source of the escalating laundry crisis, and to find out what is really happening to your socks.

It's a long shot, but at this point, you're willing to try anything.\n\nThe idea feels ridiculous, a desperate grasp at straws. But the alternative – accepting the inexplicable disappearance of your socks – is even more unsettling. You decide to proceed, a strange mix of embarrassment and genuine hope swirling within you. The question now is, what form should this ritual take? And where should it be performed – inside the machine itself, or around it?\n\nYou take a deep breath and survey your surroundings, searching for inspiration.

A faded photograph, the image barely visible beneath a layer of dust. A single, lonely sock, a victim of the Whirlwind's insatiable appetite. You line them up on the washing machine, your hands trembling slightly. \n\nThe button represents lost connections, the photograph faded memories, and the sock is self-explanatory. These are all things you will now willingly sacrifice. Perhaps these offerings will appease whatever dark god resides within the Whirlwind 2000. Or perhaps, you will just be throwing your belongings into a broken washing machine. \n\nYou take a deep breath and prepare to begin, a strange mix of silliness and desperation warring within you.

Or will you simply confirm your descent into madness?","choices":[{"entry_id":"portal_discovery_p001","content":"Select the symbolic items and start the bizarre ritual."},{"entry_id":"investigate_washer_e113","content":"Realise this is utterly ridiculous and go back to the drawing board."}],"end":null},"portal_discovery_p001":{"content":"Driven to the edge of reason, you embrace the absurdity of the moment.

A broken watch, its hands frozen at 3:17, a reminder of time lost and opportunities missed. And finally, a single, lonely black sock, a direct offering to the Whirlwind 2000's insatiable hunger. \n\nYou place the items one by one into the drum of the washing machine. The steel is cold against your fingertips. As the final item is added, you begin to dance around the machine in a circle, chanting a string of gibberish you've cobbled together from half-remembered spells and appliance repair manuals. It's a bizarre spectacle, a testament to your desperation. \n\nThe Whirlwind 2000 hums, a rhythmic pulse that seems to sync with your chanting. The digital display flickers erratically, the strange symbols swirling and shifting as if responding to your actions. Is the ritual working?

Is this working? Or are you just making things worse? The machine vibrates more intensely, the hum growing louder, more insistent. The symbols on the digital display spin wildly, forming patterns you can't quite decipher. \n\nIs the ritual working, drawing power from some unseen source?
