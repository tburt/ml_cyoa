<p class="prompt_text"><b>GPT-3 Prompt: </b>The following is a table of data for a choose-your-own-adventure book set in a theme park where you are trying to go on an exciting new ride called the Shitulator, but need to avoid the huge queues. Each row represents one page. Each page has two or three different choices. The game is won when you get to go on the Shitulator, or lost when the park closes. In the book the text is very descriptive and written in exciting language. It should not be possible to get stuck in a loop. The choices can involve interacting with items, navigating or talking to characters. No page should have similar long page text to another page. At least one page ends with the reader winning. A particular page only exists if a previous page has a choice that links to its page number.</p>
